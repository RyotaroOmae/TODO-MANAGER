todo — Simple CLI Task Manager

todo is a lightweight command-line task manager written in Bash.
It stores task lists as plain text under ~/.todo_state and supports adding, viewing, deleting, and updating tasks.
The design is minimal, fast, and highly customizable.

Features

Multiple task lists (prior, tmrr, today)

Add tasks without quotes (spaces allowed)

Numbered list display

Delete tasks by number (e.g., todo tmrr del 3)

Reset lists entirely

Automatically move tasks written yesterday in tmrr → today with todo update

Persistent storage using simple text files

Easy to customize Bash implementation

Storage Structure

All lists are stored in:

~/.todo_state/
    ├─ prior
    ├─ tmrr
    └─ today

tmrr entry format (date + task)

tmrr items include a creation date so the update command can detect “yesterday’s tasks”:

YYYY-MM-DD<TAB>Task content


Example:

2025-12-02    Prepare meeting slides

Installation

Save the script as:

~/bin/todo

Make it executable:

chmod +x ~/bin/todo

Add to your PATH (in ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.):

export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

Reload your shell:

source ~/.bashrc

Move yesterday’s tmrr tasks to today
