# todo — Extensible CLI Task Manager (Bash)

`todo` is a lightweight and extensible command-line task manager written in Bash.
It manages task lists as plain text files and allows dynamic list definitions via environment variables.

The design is intentionally simple: no database, no daemon, no shell startup hooks.

---

## Features

- Multiple task lists (e.g. `prior`, `tmrr`, `today`)
- Lists are dynamically defined via environment variables
- Add tasks without quotes (spaces allowed)
- Numbered list display
- Delete tasks by number
- Reset lists
- Automatically move tasks written *yesterday* from `tmrr` to `today`
- Persistent storage using plain text files
- Compatible with Linux and macOS

---

## Storage Structure

All task data is stored under:

~/.todo_state/

Each list corresponds to a file:

~/.todo_state/prior  
~/.todo_state/tmrr  
~/.todo_state/today  

---

## tmrr Entry Format

The list defined as `tmrr` stores items with a date prefix:

YYYY-MM-DD<TAB>Task content

Example:

2025-12-02	Prepare meeting slides

This format is required for the `todo update` command.

---

## Installation

1. Save the script as:

~/bin/todo

2. Make it executable:

chmod +x ~/bin/todo

3. Add the directory to your PATH (e.g. in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

4. Reload your shell:

source ~/.bashrc

---

## Configuration

### Define available lists

Lists are defined via the `TODO_LISTS` environment variable:

export TODO_LISTS="prior tmrr today inbox done someday"

Each entry becomes a valid list automatically.

### Define source and destination for update

By default:

tmrr  -> today

You can customize this behavior:

export TODO_TMRR_KEY=tmrr  
export TODO_TODAY_KEY=today  

---

## Usage

Show all lists:

todo

Show a specific list:

todo prior  
todo tmrr  
todo inbox  

Add an item (quotes not required):

todo prior Finish report  
todo tmrr Prepare slides  
todo inbox New idea for project  

Delete an item by number:

todo tmrr del 3  
todo prior del 1  

Reset a list:

todo today reset  
todo inbox reset  

Update: move yesterday’s tmrr items to today:

todo update

This command:
- Reads all items in the list defined by `TODO_TMRR_KEY`
- Moves items dated *yesterday* to the list defined by `TODO_TODAY_KEY`
- Removes moved items from the source list
- Leaves all other lists untouched

---

## Example Workflow

export TODO_LISTS="prior tmrr today inbox"

todo tmrr Review proposal  
todo tmrr Write slides  

todo

=== prior ===  
prior list is empty  

=== tmrr ===  
tmrr list:  
1  Review proposal  
2  Write slides  

=== today ===  
today list is empty  

=== inbox ===  
inbox list is empty  

Next day:

todo update  

todo today

today list:  
1  Review proposal  
2  Write slides  

---

## Optional: Shell Completion

Bash and Zsh completion can be added so that list names defined in `TODO_LISTS`
are available via TAB completion.

---

## Design Philosophy

- One file per list
- Plain text over structured databases
- Explicit commands over automation
- Easy to extend and modify

---

## Customization Ideas

- Add more lists via `TODO_LISTS`
- Archive tasks (`today -> done`)
- Move tasks between lists
- Edit tasks by number
- Search across lists
- Colorized output
- JSON or YAML backends
